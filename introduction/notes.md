***Notes:*** 1 zettabyte is approximately equal to 1.07 billion terabytes

**Traditional databases' capability is limited:**

- While traditional databases can handle terabytes to petabytes of data, their responsiveness decreases with larger datasets.
- However, storing and efficiently processing such vast amounts of data exceeds traditional database capabilities.
  
This is where powerful tools like big data technologies come into play, enabling the storage and processing of immense datasets efficiently.

# Spark description
## Definition

Spark is an open-source framework developed in the Scala programming language for distributed processing of large amounts of data using the MapReduce model.

It processes data in a distributed way accross clusters of several nodes.

## Spark Ecosystem

Spark Ecosystems is made up of five main components:

- Spark core: The data processing engine of Spark

- Spark SQL: A component for working with structured and semi-structured data using SQL or the DataFrame and DataSet API.

- Spark Streaming: Allows for real-time data processing and analysis. It processes live data streams from sources like Kafka, Flume, and HDFS.

- MLlib: This is the ML library of Spark, which includes algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, and more.

- GraphX: A library for graph processing and analysis, enabling parallel computation on graph-structured data.

## Spark architecture

## Advantages

- Speed: It can run up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory or 10 times faster on disk.

- Ease of use:  Spark
    - provides APIs in Scala, Java, Python and R 
    - supports many types of DBMS
    - provides high level libraries  including support for SQL queries (Spark SQL), machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and stream processing (Structured Streaming). 

- Platform Versatility: Spark can be deployed in various environments including
    - Hadoop
    - Kubernetes
    - standalone clusters
    - cloud platforms like :
        - AWS
        - Azure
        - Google Cloud
        - Cloudera Data PLatform (CDP)

## Use Cases:
- Data Processing and ETL: Transforming, cleaning, and loading large datasets.
- Real-Time Stream Processing: Monitoring, alerting, and real-time analytics.
- Machine Learning: Building scalable machine learning models.
Interactive Analysis: Performing ad-hoc queries and interactive data exploration.
- Graph Processing: Analyzing and visualizing graph data.
